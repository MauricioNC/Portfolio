          <p>
            I'm a Ruby on Rails developer, currently I support new developers
            enrolled in the Ruby on Rails developer program at BrightCoders. I
            help them when they're stuck in their daily activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm developing some practical projects to boost my profile using
            technologies like Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Hotwire, Sidekiq,
            Rspec, HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, Git, Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I'm learning new technologies like React, AWS and MongoDB

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I have a youtube channel where I share Ruby and Ruby on Rails content
          to share my knowledge with the community. This also allows me to grow
          and understand better some topics that were confusing to me and I hope
          this content helps to those how start with this programming language
          and framework. :)
