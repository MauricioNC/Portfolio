          I was member of the J&J team, primarily focused on assisting the
          development team in configuring information in the Camstar platform.
          My role involved leveraging Excel-based information on medical devices
          to tailor the system to the production team's needs. Utilizing Scrum
          methodology, our tasks and activities successfully completed, followed
          by rigorous testing by the QA team. In case of any issue identified
          during this process, my team and I went back to work into the task to
          get the issue solved. Also, sometimes I helped to my lead to test some
          configuration in the platform using basic SQL queries that let us
          identify for wrong outputs or if the production team's needed a new
          configuration, we had to create a new query to tailor the system to
          the production team's needs.
